Facebook Marketplace Always Local Chrome Plugin
======================

The reason I use Facebook Marketplace is to see things being sold by local people that I can go see myself, and pick up myself. However, Facebook Marketplace also has a lot of products that are shipped from around the country. I can't see them myself to verify what they are, and if I want something shipped to me I might as well go to Amazon.
However, Facebook does not allow you to adjust your default settings so that all searches default to "Local Pickup" as the delivery option. Every time you search for something new, you have to manually check that box.

Until now!
This extension will automatically redirect all Facebook Marketplace requests to add the "deliveryMethod=local_pick_up" query parameter, saving you the trouble of clicking the box EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU SEARCH FOR SOMETHING NEW.
